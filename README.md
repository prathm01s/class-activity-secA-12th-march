Errors Fixed:
in function "is_narc" 
- missing semicolon
- double == is not asignment operator, changed them to single =
- it seems that we are finding sum of powers of the digits of the number, so we should use the ** operator. I don't think *** is a valid operator.
- seems like a "narcissist"/"narc" number is a number which is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the total number of digits

in function "print_narc_number"
- missing semicolon
- missing semicolon infront of loop and if statement
- function spelling wrong in function call
- no comma in between arguments

function name wrong in function call,
changed it to print_narc_numbers
